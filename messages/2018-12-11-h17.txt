no u aint..
I called it spam
@Theflyingswede send me your stream link and i can set it up so it makes an announcement about it when you go live
But i check for message consistency
Thank you! ❤
Okay
www.mixer.com/Theflyingswede
There  @Kitty Purrfect
😫
Ur same size on there as me
Click on it
You should see the member count
spam is more than just unknown meat biproduct in a can... spam should be earmarked as more than a certain number of keystrokes in a given time frame... or something.. can u do a check like that?
Okay so i made it as a command
!live
hmm
wait a min
for what?
To send a link to a stream whenever that streamer goes live
!live
ohh
mhm
@Theflyingswede only admin can use that command, So whenever you go live use the command in #announcements since you are streaming on mixer mee6 can't just do it itself because it doesn't support it.
welcome @BentBen @Voxel the slime. I hope you enjoy your stay on the server ❤
